# If you want to check tests yourself
1) Clone repository to your computer
2) Open project with your IDE
3) If you want to run tests only from one folder just write - "pytest functional_tests" or "pytest pages_tests"
4) If you want to run specific test in folder write - "cd functional_tests" or "cd pages_tests". Then write - "pytest {name of test}.py"
